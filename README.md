# CARD
CARD is a Free as in Freedom productivity system.

It's not like The Pomodoro Technique® or Getting Things Done™ by David Allen
even though the techniques of these systems are widely used,
and I appreciate what these people have tried to do.

We need a Free\Libre system everyone can use adapt and build on.

CARD is supposed to be easy to use and easy to implement,
multi platform and free of copyright and trademarks,
your success is my gain.

## CARD:
  - Capture - Everything ... in a system or app you trust
  - Action - Location - Tags - What and Where
  - Rank - Importance - Time and Priority - see this as Review
  - Do - Pretty Obvious

The system can be used by most productivity applications.

Let's build on this and share your ideas!
